# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- YAML OpenAPI spec support — `import` now accepts `.yaml` and `.yml` files via built-in zero-dependency YAML parser
- Seedable PRNG (`createRng`) using mulberry32 algorithm for deterministic mock generation
- `mock --seed <number>` CLI flag for reproducible mock output
- `createRng` exported from public API
- 12 new tests covering YAML import, seeded PRNG, and deterministic mock generation
- 26 tests for the built-in YAML parser (185 total)

### Changed
- Extracted shared `generateArtifacts` and `regenerateExistingArtifacts` into `src/core/artifacts.js`, eliminating duplication across capture, sync, import, and mock commands
- Unified URL resolution — `sync` and `diff` now use `resolveEnv` from config instead of inline `new URL()` logic
- Converted all core modules (`config.js`, `fixture-store.js`, `artifacts.js`) to `fs/promises` with parallel I/O via `Promise.all`
- All CLI commands now return exit codes instead of calling `process.exit()` directly
- Centralised exit-code handling via `withExitCode` wrapper in CLI entry point
- Removed duplicate `sanitizeName` from `fixture-store.js` — now imports from `cli/utils.js`
- Renamed `inferType` in `mock-generator.js` to `inferSchemaType` to avoid collision with `generator.js`

### Fixed
- `diffObjects` now throws descriptive errors on invalid JSON string input instead of silent failures
- Auth header injection prevention — `sanitizeHeaderValue` strips `\r`, `\n`, `\0` from tokens

### Removed
- Dead code: `src/formatters/jsdoc.js` and `src/formatters/typescript.js` (unused wrapper files)
- Unused `get()` and `post()` helper functions from `http-client.js`
- `js-yaml` dependency — replaced with built-in zero-dependency YAML parser

### Docs
- README: added badges, architecture diagram, `mock:all` docs, `--seed` option, `--config` flag, contributing section
- Updated limitations section to reflect YAML support and `--seed` option

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- `capture` command — capture live API responses as JSON fixtures
- `capture --allow-error` — capture non-2xx responses (404, 500, etc.)
- `capture --env` — resolve URLs using environment config
- Config-level `auth` support (Bearer, API Key) — no need to pass tokens every time
- `types` command — generate JSDoc or TypeScript types from fixtures
- Deep recursive type generation — nested objects become named interfaces
- `list` command with `--json` output
- `diff` command — detect API drift (added/removed/changed fields)
- `diff --fail-on-drift` — CI-friendly exit code on drift
- `diff --json` — machine-readable JSON output
- `sync` command — re-capture all fixtures from original URLs
- `sync --dry-run` — preview what would change
- `import` command — generate fixtures from OpenAPI specs (JSON)
- `mock` command — generate mock data variants from existing fixtures
- `mock --vary` — control which fields get randomized
- `delete` command — remove fixtures and all associated generated files
- MSW handler generation (`--msw` flag on capture/import/mock)
- Programmatic API — all core functions exported for library usage
- OpenAPI `$ref` resolution with cycle detection
